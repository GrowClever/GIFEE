# GIFEE

**GIFEE** is "Google's infrastructure for everyone else". What does this mean? Who knows really. GIFEE the GitHub project is a place to experiment with ideas based on Google's infrastructure. It's not to be taken seriously and in fact we encourage people to try build their own versions of Google's infrastructure too.

GIFEE has a slack at [gifee.slack.com](https://gifee.slack.com). Ask [@chuhnk](https://twitter.com/chuhnk) for an invite.
